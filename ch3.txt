Greetings!
I think you are here because you want to use ChatGPT and Gemini effectively.This workshop is meant for professionals and new graduates who want to improve their communication with AI.

Outcomes
By the close of this session, you will be capable of :
Discover why some prompts are successful but others fall short when trying AI.

Make sure prompts are clear and helpful, so you get good answers and not frustration.

Gain better outcomes by relying on advanced techniques such as few-shot prompting.

Plans for Spending Our Time
These are the songs we will perform for the 2-hour session:

Begin with a warm-up session (15 min).

A quick introduction: Which industries use AI at work now? No problem if you haven’t (yet)!

Actual incidents that show good and bad uses of AI

The Fundamentals (20 min)

How do you determine a good prompt? (Tip: Presenting the project is similar to giving clear directions to a fresh intern).

Typical errors made by most people (and how to avoid them)

Now, watch how it works with a few examples (15 minutes of practice).

I will give you actual examples of:

A bad starting point → no real outcome

We are so happy with the prompt you made.

We’ll work on refining prompts so we achieve better outcomes

It’s your turn to respond (40 min)

Step 1: Rewrite these negative prompts to make them much better (you’ll get a laugh out of how silly some of them are).

Try teaching the AI by showing it examples, much like helping a new employee learn (Exercise 2).

Work on solving actual work challenges (drafting emails, making report summaries, etc.).

Promote communication among the group by letting them express their thoughts (20 minutes).

Show your most witty or entertaining prompts.

Solve problems as a team.

Grab the best ideas and secrets from each person.

Finish (10 min)

Teaching AI by Example: For instance, how you would show someone the steps to do something

Next Steps: What to do after the AI responds with almost all of your demands

Helping and Appropriate AI Answers: Avoiding problems with AI

Stories, diagrams and games will be important tools in this course.
ChatGPT and Gemini have excellent free editions, for all your needs.

Working out practice problems (The Engaging Phase!)
1. Prompt Makeover
Work on fixing these weak prompts and adding more force to them:

Before: "Please describe social media for me"

after that: "Outline some effective Instagram posts for an online coffee shop, using a few captions as illustrations

2. Show-and-Tell Prompting
Show the AI different examples of what you want it to learn.
Demonstrate by saying: "How do you say 'Good morning' in Spanish? → 'Buenos días'"
Demonstrate: "Good night means 'Buenas noches' in Spanish"

Consider saying: "Good afternoon."

3. Working through Challenging Problems
Select one and work on it to get a solution.

Kindly remind a colleague about not meeting the deadline with a firm email.

Organize these comments about customers into just 3 core improvements you should make.

Real-World Examples
A poor way to word it would be: "Make a job description"
Make a job description for a junior graphic designer who will work at a startup. List 5 main duties, 3 important skills and try to make the job description fun and exciting.

Too vague: “Help me with the presentation”
Good: "Create 5 good opening slides for a 10-minute sales pitch to people interested in funding our company producing eco-friendly packaging."
